- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cyborgdj
I'm somewhat new to cybersecurity and recently graduated from cybersecurity boot camp at HACKER U.
As I dive more into this new field, im excited to learn from the community and continue my thirst of knowledge.
I hope to meet new people in the field and learn as much as possible.
